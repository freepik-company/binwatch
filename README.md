BinWatch is a tool designed to subscribe to a MySQL database's binlog and track changes that occur in database tables. These changes are processed and sent to supported connectors in real-time.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this tool stems from the need for a system that allows simple, real-time tracking of changes in a MySQL database without requiring complex external tools that might complicate the process.

We use the [go-mysql](https://github.com/go-mysql-org/go-mysql) library to read MySQL binlogs. This library enables us to monitor MySQL binlogs and capture changes occurring in database tables.

## Configuration

To configure the tool, you need to create a YAML configuration file. Below is a configuration example:
```yaml
---
---
# BinWatch configuration file
# This file is written in YAML format

# ATTENTION!
# You can use environment variables in the configuration file. The environment variables must be written in the
# format $ENV_VAR_NAME. The environment variables will be replaced by their values at runtime.

# Logger configuration
logger:
  # debug, info, warn, error, dpanic, panic, fatal
  level: debug
  # console or json
  encoding: json

# Server name of the binwatch instance. Can be set via environment variable which will be replaced at runtime
server_name: "$HOSTNAME"

# Hashring configuration for HA and load balancing purposes
hashring:

  # Sync worker time in milliseconds to sync the ring nodes when a new node is added or removed from the ring
  sync_worker_time_ms: 300

  # Health check configuration for the hashring
  health_check:
    # Health check type. Supported types are http and icmp
    type: icmp
    # Just needed for http health check. The path to check the health of the server
    # path: "/health"
    # Timeout in seconds for the health check
    timeout: 1
    
  # For static ring discovery we need to define the server names that are part of the ring
  static_ring_discovery:
    hosts:
      - test
      - test2

  # For DNS ring discovery we need to define the domain and the port of the headless service to get
  # the list of server names that are part of the ring
  # Recommended for kubernetes deployments with headless services
  # dns_ring_discovery:
  #   domain: "dns.example.com"

# Sources configuration
# List of sources to watch for changes in the database binlog
sources:

  # MySQL source configuration
  mysql:
    host: "$MYSQL_HOST"
    port: $MYSQL_PORT
    user: "$MYSQL_USER"
    password: "$MYSQL_PASSWORD"

    # Server ID must be unique across all MySQL servers
    server_id: 100

    # Read timeout in seconds
    read_timeout: 90

    # Heartbeat period in seconds
    heartbeat_period: 60

    # Flavor of the database. MySQL or MariaDB
    flavor: mysql

    # Timeout for syncing the events in milliseconds
    sync_timeout_ms: 200

    # Just listen for events in these database-table pairs
    filter_tables:
      - database: test
        table: test

# Data connectors configuration
# List of connectors to send the data to
connectors:

  # Routes configuration for the connectors. It determines the events that will be sent to each connector and
  # the data format that will be sent to the connector.
  # Events can be insert, update or delete
  # Data format is in golang template format. The data read from the binlog will be passed to the template as .data
  routes:
    - events: ["insert", "update"]
      connector: pubsub
      data: |
        {{- printf `{ "index": "test", "id": %v, "data": %s}` .data.id (toJson .data) }}
    - events: ["delete"]
      connector: webhook
      data: |
        {{- printf `{ "index": "test", "id": %v }` .data.id }}

  # Connectors configuration. Currently only pubsub and webhook are supported.

  # PubSub connector configuration
  pubsub:
    project_id: "test-project"
    topic_id: "test-topic"

  # Webhook connector configuration
  webhook:
    tls_skip_verify: false
    url: "https://webhook.site/<id>"
    method: "POST"
    headers:
      X-BinWatch: "true"
  # credentials:
  #  username: "$WEBHOOK_USERNAME"
  #  password: "$WEBHOOK_PASSWORD"
```

## Deployment
We recommend to deploy BinWatch application with our [Helm registry](https://freepik-company.github.io/binwatch/).

```
helm repo add binwatch https://freepik-company.github.io/binwatch/
```

```
helm install binwatch binwatch/binwatch
```
